# Lists Library
## Description
This is a personal project I am currently working. It is my own implementation of various data structures and algorithms in C++. It is being developed in C++17.
## Features
- Class template for linked lists, allowing users to create and use a linked list with any kind of data
- Robust object oriented C++ code for the linked list template.
- Developed in CLion with CMake implementation
## Will be added in the future
- Test suite with GoogleTest
- Generic linked list class will be parent and Binary Tree, Stack, Queue, and Graph linked lists will inherit from parent and also be available for use.
- Option to have linked list sorted or unsorted. If sorted it will be sorted with quick sort algorithm. If sorted list will be searched with binary search.
